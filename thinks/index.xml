      <description>I would like to explain the meaning of life from the view of output.
If a person, at the end of his or her life, has no left notes, or has not embodied memorable deeds in the form of a work, I am afraid that the meaning of his or her existence only make sense when considering he or she as a animal as one of the chain of human reproduction.</description>
