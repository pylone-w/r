<p>I would like to explain the meaning of life from the view of output.</p>
<p>If a person, at the end of his or her life, has no left notes, or has not embodied memorable deeds in the form of a work, I am afraid that the meaning of his or her existence only make sense when considering he or she as a animal as one of the chain of human reproduction. But as a human, no output makes no sense.</p>
<p>They spend most of their lives running around in survival, go dead in the rush, like my grandparents and fathers, who exhausted themselves on a small piece of farmland and in human affairs, who devoted themselves to raising the next generation. It can be said that they have tried their best to live. When they finished their lives and buried their coffins in the earth, their lives melted away into the yellow earth like fading leaves. There is no record, no trace, no summary, no message. All the ups and downs, the sweet and sour, the joys and sorrows, all are gone. Their lives will remain in the memories of our next generation in scattered images, which will inevitably fade and fade away until there is no trace of them. What a sad life.</p>
<p>The Internet may have reduced this sadness for modern people. My wife told me the other day that if you don&rsquo;t post your daily life on Wetchat, you will have nothing left when you are old. I agree, but I didn&rsquo;t tell her that I was recording it in another way. It&rsquo;s no doubt that a few words coupling with a nice photo can be see as a kind ofrecord or output, but it&rsquo;s too fragmented. It belongs to the category of keeping the crumbs of life, capturing an image of life and moving from brain storage to cloud storage. It can help you flash back to that moment when you old. But it is only a precise flashback of the image, no different in essence from a vague memory. It has no reflection or condensation of life, no insights of its own, it is too scattered, too superficial and too popularization. A scattered and shallow record is floating, it does not settle down, it has no roots, no soul.</p>
<p>Therefore, going back to the original purpose of writing these words, no record means no experience. If you want to leave something behind, you would better keep experiencing, creating, summarising, condensing and polishing, wringing out the water from your life and coming up with some dry goods.</p>
